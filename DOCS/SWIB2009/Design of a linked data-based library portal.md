abstract: 'An important trend that can be clearly seen in libraries in recent years is the integration of as many (bibliographical) data sources as possible under a uniform interface. On the one hand, however, these efforts are often about solutions whose sustainability and portability is limited, on the other hand, implicitly existing relationships between bibliographic and administrative information are not taken into account -- which stocks and departments, for example, are actually hidden behind “computer science”? In the “Web of Data”, on the other hand, a wide variety of resources from a wide variety of domains and local as well as global sources can be related to one another and linked to one another. By adhering to a few basic principles, a high degree of interoperability and reusability of the data can be achieved. With this approach, the Bochum project “Integrated Library Portal” wants to create an infrastructure that can be used to react as flexibly and sustainably as possible to the immediate local conditions (two-tier library system, University Alliance Metropolis Ruhr) and medium-term requirements (integration of heterogeneous primary data).'

# Design of a linked data-based library portal
[[André Hagenbruch]]

An important trend that can be clearly seen in libraries in recent years is the integration of as many (bibliographical) data sources as possible under a uniform interface. On the one hand, however, these efforts are often about solutions whose sustainability and portability is limited, on the other hand, implicitly existing relationships between bibliographic and administrative information are not taken into account – which stocks and departments, for example, are actually hidden behind “computer science”? In the “Web of Data”, on the other hand, a wide variety of resources from a wide variety of domains and local as well as global sources can be related to one another and linked to one another. By adhering to a few basic principles, a high degree of interoperability and reusability of the data can be achieved. With this approach, the [[Bochum]] [[project]] “Integrated Library Portal” wants to create an [[Templates/infrastructure]] that can be used to react as flexibly and sustainably as possible to the immediate local conditions (two-tier library system, University Alliance Metropolis Ruhr) and medium-term requirements (integration of heterogeneous primary data).

abstract: 'Existing library applications - catalogues, portal systems or open access repositories - are not prepared to actually exploit the opportunities linked data offers. In order to be able to make better use of sources available on the Semantic Web, such as the standard economics thesaurus, the ZBW has therefore started to develop a lightweight application architecture. It is based on web services that query the data from Semantic Web (-SPARQL) endpoints and make it accessible via a simple, use-case-centric REST interface. This means that the data can be used directly on the websites by conventional web applications. A beta implementation of two key use cases - thesaurus support in indexing and in retrieval - is presented and it is demonstrated.'

# Integration of linked data into existing library applications
[[Joachim Neubert]], [[Timo Borst]]

Existing library applications - catalogues, portal systems or open access repositories - are not prepared to actually exploit the opportunities linked data offers. In order to be able to make better use of sources available on the Semantic Web, such as the standard economics thesaurus, the [[ZBW]] has therefore started to develop a lightweight application architecture. It is based on web services that query the data from Semantic Web (-[[SPARQL]]) endpoints and make it accessible via a simple, use-case-centric [[REST]]. This means that the data can be used directly on the websites by conventional web applications. A beta implementation of two key use cases - [[thesaurus]] support in indexing and in retrieval - is presented and it is demonstrated.

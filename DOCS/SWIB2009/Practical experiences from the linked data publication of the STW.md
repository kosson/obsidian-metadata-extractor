abstract: 'In the spring of 2009, the ZBW published the Standard Thesaurus for Economics as Linked Data. The aim of this form (like the publication under a non-commercial Creative Commons license) was to support re-use by humans and machines. We chose the SKOS (only recently approved as a W3C standard) as the data model. The data is made available as websites with embedded RDFa, as an RDF/XML download and can be queried online (via SPARQL endpoint). What we learned - how we proceeded, what difficulties we had to overcome, what tools we used - and what could be useful for others is the subject of this article.'

# Practical experiences from the linked data publication of the STW
[[Joachim Neubert]]

In the spring of 2009, the [[ZBW]] published the [[Standard Thesaurus for Economics]] as Linked Data. The aim of this form (like the publication under a non-commercial Creative Commons license) was to support re-use by humans and machines. We chose the [[ACRONYMS/SKOS]] (only recently approved as a W3C standard) as the data model. The data is made available as websites with embedded [[RDFa]], as an [[RDF/XML]] download and can be queried online (via [[SPARQL]] endpoint). What we learned - how we proceeded, what difficulties we had to overcome, what tools we used - and what could be useful for others is the subject of this article.

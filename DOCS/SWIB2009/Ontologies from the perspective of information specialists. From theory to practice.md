abstract: 'Ontologies are the core components of the Semantic Web, which fulfill the actual semantic task of the whole system: transporting content. However, there is still no unanimous opinion in specialist circles as to what an ontology represents in itself, what properties it has and what potential it conceals. There are basically two perspectives on the nature of ontologies - that of librarians and information specialists, which is determined by the primary semantic interest, and that of programmers, who put the technical problems in the foreground. The "semantic" perspective is hardly represented in research and is rarely discussed in the professional world. A detailed discussion in the community can create a better understanding of the advantages of ontologies as a conceptual system and lead to wider use in practice. In the article, this question is discussed from the point of view of information science and explained using a practical example. In addition, practical experience with the development of ontologies using Protégé is reported.'

# Ontologies from the perspective of information specialists. From theory to practice
[[Elena Semanova]]

[[Ontologies]] are the core components of the Semantic Web, which fulfill the actual semantic task of the whole system: transporting content. However, there is still no unanimous opinion in specialist circles as to what an [[ontology]] represents in itself, what properties it has and what potential it conceals. There are basically two perspectives on the nature of ontologies - that of librarians and information specialists, which is determined by the primary semantic interest, and that of programmers, who put the technical problems in the foreground. The “semantic” perspective is hardly represented in research and is rarely discussed in the professional world. A detailed discussion in the community can create a better understanding of the advantages of ontologies as a [[conceptual system]] and lead to wider use in practice. In the article, this question is discussed from the point of view of [[information science]] and explained using a practical example. In addition, practical experience with the development of ontologies using [[Protégé]] is reported.

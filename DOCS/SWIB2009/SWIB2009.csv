By adhering to a few basic principles, a high degree of interoperability and reusability of the data can be achieved. With this approach, the Bochum project “Integrated Library Portal” wants to create an infrastructure that can be used to react as flexibly and sustainably as possible to the immediate local conditions (two-tier library system, University Alliance Metropolis Ruhr) and medium-term requirements (integration of heterogeneous primary data)."alias,type,event,year,partof,tags,title,alt,resources,author,abstract

Bibo builds on various ontologies such as Dublin Core (DC), Friend of a Friend (FOAF), the Event Ontology and the BBC Program Ontology. After an overview, it will be discussed how the ontology will assert itself as the standard for bibliographic data in the Semantic Web and whether this will make existing bibliographic data formats superfluous."alias,type,event,year,partof,tags,title,alt,resources,author,abstract

The service is a work in progress, and in this presentation Anders will describe the strategic thinking behind the LIBRIS Linked Data project, as well as the thoughts and ideas that have emerged as a consequence of it. Such ideas will include the implications of viewing bibliographic information as open networks of data, rather than as closed (or semi-closed) repositories of records. The presentation will also include a discussion of how and why libraries should use linked data as a way of connecting to the rest of the world wide web."alias,type,event,year,partof,tags,title,alt,resources,author,abstract

And Chronicling America (http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) which is an online archive of 1.5 million historic American newspaper pages, which makes repository objects available as Linked Data using the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) vocabulary. The presentation will include tips on how to leverage existing web technologies to make linked data available, and potential areas for future development."alias,type,event,year,partof,tags,title,alt,resources,author,abstract

This service would enable direct use of all national bibliographic data, including all authority files, by the Semantic Web Community. In this short lecture, the motivation for this step will be explained and the planned design of the service will be discussed. But it is also about the urgently needed entry into the discussion about the consequences that this new way of data exchange could have for libraries: new cooperation models, extended requirements for cooperative data maintenance and a new regulation of data usage rights."alias,type,event,year,partof,tags,title,alt,resources,author,abstract

The first prototype is currently in the design phase and there is no shortage of unanswered questions: Even if there are already models for linked data in the librarianship environment, the implementation of such a service for the German-speaking area still involves a good deal of research and development . We would like to take the opportunity and in this lecture present the current considerations on the architecture, persistent identification and representation of data in RDF and discuss them with the participants of the workshop."

abstract: "The aim of the first prototype is to gather practical experience with the operation of such a service together with the network partners. The first prototype is currently in the design phase and there is no shortage of unanswered questions: Even if there are already models for linked data in the librarianship environment, the implementation of such a service for the German-speaking area still involves a good deal of research and development . We would like to take the opportunity and in this lecture present the current considerations on the architecture, persistent identification and representation of data in RDF and discuss them with the participants of the workshop."

# The national bibliography as linked data – technical aspects of the DNB’s linked data service
[[Lars G. Svensson]], [[Jürgen Kett]]

The aim of the first prototype is to gather practical experience with the operation of such a service together with the network partners. The first prototype is currently in the design phase and there is no shortage of unanswered questions: Even if there are already models for linked data in the librarianship environment, the implementation of such a service for the German-speaking area still involves a good deal of research and development . We would like to take the opportunity and in this lecture present the current considerations on the architecture, persistent identification and representation of data in [[RDF]] and discuss them with the participants of the workshop.

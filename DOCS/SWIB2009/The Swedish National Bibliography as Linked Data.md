abstract: 'LIBRIS, the Swedish union catalog used for cataloging by approximately 170 library institutions and home of the Swedish National Bibliography, has since the beginning of 2008 been available as Linked Open Data. The service is a work in progress, and in this presentation Anders will describe the strategic thinking behind the LIBRIS Linked Data project, as well as the thoughts and ideas that have emerged as a consequence of it. Such ideas will include the implications of viewing bibliographic information as open networks of data, rather than as closed (or semi-closed) repositories of records. The presentation will also include a discussion of how and why libraries should use linked data as a way of connecting to the rest of the world wide web.'

# The Swedish National Bibliography as Linked Data
[[Anders Söderbäck]]

[[LIBRIS]], the Swedish [[union catalog]] used for cataloging by approximately 170 library institutions and home of the [[Swedish National Bibliography]], has since the beginning of 2008 been available as [[Linked Open Data]]. The service is a work in progress, and in this presentation Anders will describe the strategic thinking behind the LIBRIS Linked Data project, as well as the thoughts and ideas that have emerged as a consequence of it. Such ideas will include the implications of viewing [[bibliographic information]] as open networks of data, rather than as closed (or semi-closed) repositories of records. The presentation will also include a discussion of how and why libraries should use linked data as a way of connecting to the rest of the world wide web.

abstract: 'If we ask ourselves where all the metadata and ontologies for the Semantic Web come from or how we want to deal with coexisting, competing systems in the future, we can fall back on proven models in our search for solutions. The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model is a formal ontology that has been in development since 1996 and is now the official ISO 21127:2006 standard. Although less well known in the library environment than in the museum sector, CIDOC CRM offers a formalized conceptual model to integrate disparately structured information from the field of cultural heritage, preferably in open systems, and to convey and exchange information between applications. The semantic focus is on data structures, terminology for domains and knowledge about entities (time, place, person, object), their properties and relationships with each other. In the article, the CIDOC CRM is to be introduced in relation to selected museum object and context information using the example of the astronomer Tycho Brahe and attention is drawn to the use of the model as a meta-ontology.'

# Metadata and the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) - An introduction with application examples
[[Katrin Teichmann]]

If we ask ourselves where all the metadata and [[ontologies]] for the Semantic Web come from or how we want to deal with coexisting, competing systems in the future, we can fall back on proven models in our search for solutions. The [[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]] is a formal ontology that has been in development since 1996 and is now the official [[ISO 21127]]:2006 standard. Although less well known in the library environment than in the museum sector, [[CIDOC CRM]] offers a formalized [[conceptual model]] to integrate disparately [[structured information]] from the field of [[cultural heritage]], preferably in open systems, and to convey and exchange information between applications. The semantic focus is on [[data structures]], terminology for domains and knowledge about [[entities]] (time, place, person, object), their properties and relationships with each other. In the article, the [[CIDOC]] CRM is to be introduced in relation to selected [[museum object]] and context information using the example of the astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and attention is drawn to the use of the model as a meta-ontology.

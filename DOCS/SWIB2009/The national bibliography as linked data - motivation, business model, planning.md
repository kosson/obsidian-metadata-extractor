abstract: 'The German National Library is currently working on setting up a service that aims to publish its knowledge base as linked data. This service would enable direct use of all national bibliographic data, including all authority files, by the Semantic Web Community. In this short lecture, the motivation for this step will be explained and the planned design of the service will be discussed. But it is also about the urgently needed entry into the discussion about the consequences that this new way of data exchange could have for libraries: new cooperation models, extended requirements for cooperative data maintenance and a new regulation of data usage rights.'

# The national bibliography as linked data - motivation, business model, planning
[[Jürgen Kett]]

The [[German National Library]] is currently working on setting up a service that aims to publish its [[knowledge base]] as [[linked data]]. This service would enable direct use of all [[national bibliographic data]], including all [[authority files]], by the Semantic Web Community. In this short lecture, the motivation for this step will be explained and the planned design of the service will be discussed. But it is also about the urgently needed entry into the discussion about the consequences that this new way of data exchange could have for libraries: new cooperation models, extended requirements for cooperative data maintenance and a new regulation of data usage rights.

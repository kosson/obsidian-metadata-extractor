abstract: 'The CERN Library is preparing the final steps to publish the complete bibliographic data on the web under a free license. Initially, these should be made available in MARC-XML. At the same time, there are various considerations as to how this data can be presented in the framework as linked data. For this, the experience of LIBRIS should be used. This approach is to be extended to other resources at the same time. There are already a few ideas that should be presented in the lecture.'

# Free Data - The Road to Linked Data
[[Patrick Danowski]]

The [[CERN Library]] is preparing the final steps to publish the complete [[bibliographic data]] on the web under a [[free license]]. Initially, these should be made available in [[MARC-XML]]. At the same time, there are various considerations as to how this data can be presented in the framework as [[linked data]]. For this, the experience of [[LIBRIS]] should be used. This approach is to be extended to other resources at the same time. There are already a few ideas that should be presented in the lecture.

abstract: 'The "W3C Linking Open Data Initiative (LOD)" aims to expose databases in a structured form on the web so that they can also be reused in other application contexts. DBpedia.org was launched in July 2007 and since then has provided Wikipedia databases in several languages in a structured form. Further databases from a wide variety of domains followed within a very short time, including those from the library sector (e.g.: Library of Congress, Swedish Union Catalogue). The central properties of these databases are, firstly, that they can be accessed on the web in a technically simple manner and in a structured form, and secondly, that they contain references (links) to semantically relevant datasets in other databases (e.g.: DBpedia.org). The lecture "Linked Data in the Context of Digital Library Systems" first addresses the question "What is Linked Data?" received. This is followed by an overview of current developments and trends in the area of linked data that are relevant to libraries. A description of possible advantages and disadvantages for libraries forms the conclusion of the lecture.'

# Linked data in the context of digital library systems
[[Bernhard Haslhofer]]

The “W3C Linking Open Data Initiative ([[LOD]])” aims to expose databases in a structured form on the web so that they can also be reused in other application contexts. [[DBpedia.org]] was launched in July 2007 and since then has provided [[Wikipedia]] databases in several languages in a structured form. Further databases from a wide variety of domains followed within a very short time, including those from the library sector (e.g.: [[Library of Congress]], [[Swedish Union Catalogue]]). The central properties of these databases are, firstly, that they can be accessed on the web in a technically simple manner and in a structured form, and secondly, that they contain references (links) to semantically relevant datasets in other databases (e.g.: DBpedia.org). The lecture “Linked Data in the Context of Digital Library Systems” first addresses the question “What is Linked Data?” received. This is followed by an overview of current developments and trends in the area of linked data that are relevant to libraries. A description of possible advantages and disadvantages for libraries forms the conclusion of the lecture.

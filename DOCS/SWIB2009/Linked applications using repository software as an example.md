abstract: 'Linked Data is a cornerstone of the Semantic Web. After a few quiet years, developments in the field of the Semantic Web (also) are picking up speed again because (open) linked data is available in large numbers thanks to projects such as DBpedia. However, data is only part of the business. Operating on this data, creating and processing it, is another cornerstone. There is a need to complement the concept of linked data with that of linked applications. This lecture presents an approach to using ontologies as a basis for linked applications using repository software as an example. Software of this type is suitable as an object of investigation simply because there are far-reaching efforts to network it (OA network, DFG call for proposals "Establishment and networking of repositories").'

# Linked applications using repository software as an example
[[Felix Ostrowski]]

Linked Data is a cornerstone of the Semantic Web. After a few quiet years, developments in the field of the Semantic Web (also) are picking up speed again because (open) linked data is available in large numbers thanks to projects such as [[DBpedia]]. However, data is only part of the business. Operating on this data, creating and processing it, is another cornerstone. There is a need to complement the concept of linked data with that of linked applications. This lecture presents an approach to using ontologies as a basis for linked applications using repository software as an example. Software of this type is suitable as an object of investigation simply because there are far-reaching efforts to network it (OA network, [[DFG]] call for proposals “Establishment and networking of repositories”).

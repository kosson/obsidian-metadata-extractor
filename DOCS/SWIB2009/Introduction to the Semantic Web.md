# Introduction to the Semantic Web
[[Jakob Voss]]

The Semantic Web as a concrete project is at least a decade old; Although it corresponds much more closely to the original vision of the web than today’s World Wide Web, concrete implementation only gained momentum with [[Linked Data]]. The introduction is intended to give an insight into why and in what form the [[Semantic Web]] has become established and where its main focus and [[limitations]] lie, without going into technical details.

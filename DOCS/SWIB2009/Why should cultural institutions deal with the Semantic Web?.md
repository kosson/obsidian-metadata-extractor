# Why should cultural institutions deal with the Semantic Web?
[[Stefan Gradmann]]

Why is a lecture with the title question “Why should [[cultural institutions]] deal with the Semantic Web?” necessary at all? The reasons are perhaps less obvious than the conference participants might realize. There are bad reasons for dealing with the ‘Semantic Web’ … “… because nowadays you have to write that in funding applications” “… because [[Web 2.0]] will be followed by [[Web 3.0]]” and good (or at least better) reasons …&quot;… with that them also in the future as parts of ‘[[knowledge architectures]]’.

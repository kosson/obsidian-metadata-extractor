# The Bibliographic Ontology as a successor to bibliographic data formats
[[Jakob Voss]]

The [[Bibliographic Ontology]] ([[bibo]]) arose from the consideration of how the literature management program [[Zotero]] could be brought together with the Semantic Web. After two and a half years of development in an open discussion process with over 100 participants, version 1.3 is now available. of the [[RDF]] [[vocabulary]] for bibliographic data. Bibo builds on various ontologies such as [[Dublin Core]] (DC), [[Friend of a Friend]] ([[FOAF]]), the Event Ontology and the [[BBC Program Ontology]]. After an overview, it will be discussed how the ontology will assert itself as the standard for [[bibliographic data]] in the Semantic Web and whether this will make existing bibliographic data formats superfluous.
